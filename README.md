Here's a README file content that explains the three files in your project, GroupChatPy:

GroupChatPy
GroupChatPy is a Python application that enables users to create and join secure, real-time chat groups using TCP sockets. This README outlines the three primary components of the project: client.py, server.py, and the design document.

Files in the Project
1. client.py
This script acts as the client side of the chat application. It allows users to connect to a server, join existing groups or create new ones, and communicate with other members of the group. It includes functionalities for:

Connecting to the server with an IP address and port.
Choosing to join an existing group or create a new group.
Handling user input for group selection and messages.
Sending and receiving messages in real-time.
2. server.py
The server script manages all clients' connections, group creations, and message transmissions. Key functionalities include:

Listening for incoming connections.
Handling different client requests such as joining or creating groups.
Storing group information, including passwords for access control.
Broadcasting messages to group members.
Managing client disconnections and maintaining group integrity.
3. server and clients in python yaniv hajaj ori glam.docx
This document provides a detailed theoretical background and an overview of the project implementation. It describes:

The use of TCP and UDP protocols in the application.
The five-layer model of network communication which this project is based on.
Detailed explanations of how the client and server interact, manage data, and ensure communication is secure and reliable.
Getting Started
To run GroupChatPy, start the server.py first to ensure it's listening for incoming connections, then run client.py on one or more machines to begin creating or joining chat groups.
